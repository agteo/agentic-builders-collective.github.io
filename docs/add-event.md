# Add An Event

Use this when someone asks an agent: "I want to add a new event."

## Agent Prompt

```text
Add this event to the Agentic Builders Collective website.

Follow docs/add-event.md.
Follow docs/id-guidelines.md for the filename/eventId.
Create one new Markdown file in src/content/events/.
Use a YYYY-MM-DD-prefixed kebab-case filename because it becomes the eventId.
Use personId for listed hosts/speakers, or name for external people.
Keep the change additive and do not reformat unrelated entries.
Run pnpm check and pnpm build.

## Notes

- The filename becomes the `eventId` used by presentations.
- Event filenames must start with the event date as `YYYY-MM-DD`, for example `2026-05-14-agentic-builders-at-example-labs.md`.
- Do not use random numeric suffixes. If the event title collides, add the venue or format to the filename.
- `kind` must be `meetup` or `learning`.
- `status` must be `upcoming` or `past`.
- Use `personId` only when the person exists in `members` or `organisers`.
- Presentation slides are added separately in `src/content/presentations/presentations.yaml`.
